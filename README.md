## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

Container makes things more simpler. I don't know why I didn't use it. Anyway, this is just a simple project, it's a bit messy but at least it works.

### Continued development

Next time, I want to use Svelte to build another challenge. It's sounds simpler than React so maybe it's better?

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - Tailwind CSS docs had (almost) 90% of answers for any problem I'd face with tailwind.
